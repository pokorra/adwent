## Advent Calendar
This project contains simple Advent Calendar made for one Publishing House so kids could have so fun during December

# Mechanism
The mechanism inside of this project is really simple, we are just checking which day is it and, based on current date, we are letting our viewers see proper amount of tiles-days. So this is the Non-Cheating Advent Calendar

# Look
Project layout was prepared in pure CSS with usage of BEM class naming method, also SMACSS method helped me with general planning of folders/files structure

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
